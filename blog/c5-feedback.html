  <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>

  <h3>Pairing</h3>
    <p>“Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success.” ~~ Henry Ford </p>
    <p>
     Pairing is something I find essential for quicker progress and efficiency. I have paired for projects in the past and it has been of tremendous help. My outlook towards pairing is that more the ideas the better result. When I realized I will be pairing for Devbootcamp challenges, I felt comfortable. Pairing has always brought the best out of me and I was confident it will do so in future.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I think what was it like to pair with others to solve a challenge, the answer is straightforward. I enjoyed the two way conversation and exchange of ideas. According to me, pairing brings to the table a certain level of challenges but more so advantages. When there are two people invovled on one challenge there is always going to be certain level of differences as well as similarities. It is our duty to embrace both and work towards being successful. In almost all pairing sessions there was one thing I always enjoyed, that is, getting a different perspective to situations. I feel there is so much to learn and this is a great platform for it. Personally, I end up focussing more while pairing than individually. I feel pairing is sucessful especially for brain draining challenges. Having a partner through such situations can be a constant reminder of time and a fresh set of eyes always helps. Apart from just academic topics, pairing has helped better myself in many cultural aspects. I have come across organised partners who have made the pairing session go smooth due to their organized skills. I have tried to incorporate that in my working. Apart from that, some of my pairs have been exceptional at communicating and are very social. Its nice to get to know more people around you and pairing enables that. </p>
    <p>
      Some caveats of pairing are that not always do we pair with people who share the same knowledge or comfort level. Sometimes when I have a partner more knowledgeble than me,  I start to think that I have nothing important to contribute. I feel low in confidence and I start to wonder if I will be able to get through this sucessfully. At the same time, it also urges me to put in more efforts to better my understanding. In addition, there are times when I feel as though my partner has fallen behind in the material, or I notice that my partner is lacking communication.It can be frustrating, and I feel I could have completed the challenge alone much faster. Understanding and communication is key in situations like this. For example, I try to inform my partner that I will be prepared with reading the summary of a challenge and all material associated with it before pairing. So that my partner is equally prepared.

    <h3>Feedback</h3>

    <p>
      "True intuitive expertise is learned from prolonged experience with good feedback on mistakes." ~~ Daniel Kahneman
    </p>
      <p>
       Giving and receiving feedback has always made me nervous. This time wasn't any exception. I always find myself anxious while receiving feedback although what I received were all very specific, actionable and kind. I have managed to convince myself to accept the feedback in a constructive manner. I decided to not get over excited about good feedback or get dejected by bad feedback. Most of the feedback I received have been very helpful in understanding a great deal about myself. I analyze myself after every pairing session so that I improve. Hence, my approcah has been different from one pairing session to another. A couple of the feedbacks I received said, I should check in with my partner sometimes as they felt lost. While few others said, I did a great job communicating my ideas clearly, as well with giving and taking the flow of communication. I believe I had already sensed that my partner was lost in a particular pairing session and worked on it for the next one. One common constructive comment I received was about my time management skills. I tend to get carried away and excited about the challenge and I should be considerate about the other persons time. I agree on that feedback and moving forward, I will try and time-box the pairing sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find giving feedback harder than receiving feedback. Especially the part where I wonder how honest should I be. I do not know much about the person I am working with. So, my kind and honest feedback can be received as rude or too honest. It depends on how sensitive the person is. I find it difficult to express myself in a succinct, apt and kind language. The feedback I received for the initial set of reviews I wrote were that they were not actionable and specific but kind. The reason I received this reponse was because I found it difficult to write an honest contructive feedback about a session. Although, I did pick it up from these reviews and tried to better my feedback giving skills. I agree that constructive feedback is pivitol for improvement and at DBC all of us are looking learn and improve our skills. Hence, I feel providing actionable feedback is important for positive growth.
