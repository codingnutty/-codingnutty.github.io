  <h2>What's your thinking style?</h2>
  <h2>Thinking and Mindset</h2>
  <h4>June 26th 2015</h4>
  <section id="content">
    <p>
      <a href ="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.html">Anthony F. Gregorc, Ph. D.</a> started research on thinking or learning style in 1969. A model was developed in 1984.  Through his work he has categorized perceptual quality to concrete and abstract and ordering ability to sequential and random. He says all individuals posses a part of all these qualities. Some use one more than the other comfortably. Over a period of time these qualities might change in an individual.The abilities in combination are listed below.
      <ol>
          <li>Concrete Sequential</li>
          <li>Abstract Sequential</li>
          <li>Concrete Random</li>
          <li>Abstract Random</li>
      </ol>

      The quiz result described my thinking style as <a href ="http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~jgutliph/Books/learning_styles/Abstract_Random.html">Abstarct Random</a>. I must say after reading the description I relate to 9 out of 10 of the characteristics. I thrive in group environment and build relationships easily. Also, I am sensitive towards others, friendly and collborative. I usually like to plan and finish my tasks in time to be able to focus on extra-curricular or social activities. I can learn best when I have the ability to be creative with my work. I feel all the above describe me well and perfectly fit into the Abstarct Random thinking style. DBC is a place where every individual has the ability to be creative, and help each other. Considering its a shared environment, I know it will benefit me. DBC allows me to be creative and independent as well. The pair programming concept will benefit my personality. Although, my personality reacts poor to criticism. I believe I take things personally, so this criticism can be converted to a constructive one. This personality is described to struggle with perfectionists, I feel it was something I sturggled with when I was youger. Over time I have developed patience and I handle perfectionists well. So, Phase-0 until now has been great with the collborative learning style. It has enbaled me to understand concepts well and work even more efficient.I feel I have struggled with extensive reading but I like to learn by watching videos more than reading so I try to alternate. I haven't yet faced a competitive environment or felt pressurized yet in order for me to guage.

    <h2>Fixed Versus Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      I was having a conversation about fixed and growth mindset with a few friends just before I came across the article by DBC. It was quite interesting as I was just understanding that I have many traits of the fixed mindset category. I feel it is good to have a balance of both. One should keep an open outlook to have a constructive future. Considering I am Abstract Random thinker, I automatically fall under many of the fixed mindset characteristics.For example, I have difficulty in accepting negetive feedback. So I used to ignore it. Last couple of years, I have identitfied this and have been working towards using any criticism as a contructive feedback. As a kid I have been very pesimistic and I am trying to have a postivie outlook towards failures. I have a competitive behaviour and feel thretened by competition. I should take it at stride and make it healthy. Moreover, these days success stories and successful people around me make me feel inspired rather than dejected. Although, I wonder how strange it is that I love collborative atmosphere yet fear competition. As a first step, I have embraced my personality the way it is before I work towards being all-rounded.I feel setting a limit will shun growth and knowledge and growth should be boundless. When a person does not know their limit they keeps trying to outdo themselves. Setting a limit for onself will make them plateau eventually. This is something I am trying to work on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope understanding my thinking and my mindset helps me become adaptive and enables me to have boundless growth. To understand your mindset, please feel free to read through <a href = "http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">this</a>.
