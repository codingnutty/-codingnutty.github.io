  <h2>Web Security Issues</h2>
  <h4>July 09 2015</h4>
  <section id="content">
    <p>
     This weeks cultural blog is going to focus on Issues faced by the Tech Industry. In today's age every industry is posed with challenges. Although the leaders of the country mostly focus on the political or social-economic issues soon Technology is going to be at the center of it all. Almost the entire earth is connected via internet and everything is inter-related using technology.It is difficult to imagine a life a without technology in times to come. Everything internet speaks revolved around is Internet protocol. In today's world anyone can create a website and share their ideas or thoughts. One just has to create a domain name and own a space and build whatever they like. Although Internet has made life easy there has always been a security hindrance associated with it. One often questions about the authenticity and security of a website.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web browswers are the most commonly used applications on daily basis across the world. It allows information such as image, video and any time of content to be displayed on the computer from a remote server. Most of us have our personal information along with pictures uploaded in social networking websites. We use online transaction systems for money transfers. The webservice industry has connected vendors and buyers across the world. That much information and accessibility makes it an ideal target for malicious individuals who wish to play with data and interfere with regular activities. As companies rely increasingly on the Internet for communications, data and transactions, so the criminals are being tempted by bigger prizes. The game of cat-and-mouse has stepped up a notch and criminals have changed strategy.</p>
      <p>
        Few common methods of attack are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>An email pretends to be from a legitimate source,like a bank.Recipents log in, but details are harvested, funds stolen or identities misused. </li>
          <li>Malware creators play on fear and curiosity. A legitimate site, or a fake one, may point to a juicy news story or video. But the destination infects the PC. Or it may issue a fake virus alert and then compel visitors to buy malware that's masquerading as the remedy. </li>
          <li>The important plug-ins needed by browsers can sometimes leave the door open too. People forget the download security updates for add-ons like Flash Player or Acrobat. </li>
          <li>Any security breach can prove devastating. Malware and viruses slow down machines and damage productivity. Admins waste hours trying to identify and fix problems.</li>
      </p>
      <p>Most Websites work around the AAA strategy to address security issues. The 3 main security pricipals used are:
      <ol>
        <li>Authentication</li>
        <li>Authorization</li>
        <li>Encryption</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Encryption should be used whenever people are giving out personal information to register for something or buy a product. Doing so ensures the person’s privacy during the communication. Encryption is also often used when the data returned by the server to the client should be protected, such as a financial statement or test results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authentication should be used whenever you want to know exactly who is using or viewing you site. Weblogin is San Jose State University’s primary method of authentication. Other commercial websites such as Amazon.com require people to login before buying products so they know exactly who their purchasers are.
    </p>
    <p>Authorization should be used whenever you want to control viewer access of certain pages. For example, San Jose State University students are not authorized to view certain web pages dedicated to professors and administration. The authorization requirements for a site are typically defined in a website’s .htaccess file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authentication and Authorization are often used together. For example, students at San Jose State are required to authenticate before accessing the Student Link. The authentication they provide determines what data they are authorized to see. The authorization step prevents students from seeing data of other students.
    </p>
    <p>
     In summary, web-based threats are growing, while shifting in shape and complexity. But a combination of smart policies and solutions will minimize risk and maximize peace of mind.
