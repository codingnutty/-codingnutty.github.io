  <h2>Values- To Combat Stereotype threat</h2>
  <h4>July 30 2015</h4>
  <section id="content">

    <p>My last week's culture blog was about <a href="http://codingnutty.github.io/blog/c6-stereotype_threat.html">Identifying Stereotype Threat</a>. This week my blog is about identifying values within you that make you feel happiest, proudest and most satisfied and reiterate it yourself in times when you feel inadequte due to negetive stereotyping. In my opinion, one can combat stereotype threat by self-affirmation, open discussion and knowledge. Being open and seeking knowledge helps us to be aware, which will prevent us from being that either ends of giving or receiving stereotype threats. I also feel one must respect to feel respected. Keeping that in mind very important for each one of us. Dependency to major extent causes one to feel low about themselves in dire situations. One can try and be as independent as possible to develop a feeling of confidence </p>
    <p>
     It is important to self-introspect on values which will help one come to terms with their vulnerabilities and deal with them. Knowing what you value will help prioritize your life. I was provided with a set of values that describes how I feel when I am the happiest, proudest and self-satisfied. For a person like me self-satisfaction is difficult. I am always seeking for something more but that doesn't mean I am not happy and proud of what I have done or I do. So here is a list of values I choose for myself:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Family</li>
      <li>Close Relationships</li>
      <li>Accomplishment</li>
      <li>Compassion</li>
      <li>Creativity</li>
      <li>Helping Others</li>
      <li>Independence </li>
      <li>Inspiration</li>
      <li> Integrity</li>
      <li>Friendships</li>
      <li>Responsibility</li>
      <li>Respect</li>
    </ul>
     <p>
      I try to live upto these values as much as possible. For me family is one place where no one is judgemental and my vulnerabilities are covered. I am able to easily accept myself completely amidst family. I am very close to my family. Accomplishments vary from time to time in life. At sometimes I do feel accomplished and in certain times I feel I need to achieve a lot more and that needs a lot of hardwork. I am an extravert. I like getting my energy from active involvement in events and having a lot of different activities. I'm excited when I'm around people and I like to energize other people. Having close relationships and friendships matter to me as they energize me. I try to maintain integrity as much as I can ond aily basis. I try to treat people better than the way I expect to be treated. Its good to have someone inspirational in your life to have a sense of accomplishment. I make it point to respect people, their sentiments and their feelings. I go beyond to make sure I do not disrespect anyone. Although, travelling across continents, I realzied this word holds different meaning. Having a sense of responsibility helps us stay alert about life and handle thing with care. I can advice people about life, compassion, responsibility and respect.
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of all these values I enjoy helping others. In today's world we are so busy that one doesn't have the time to help themselves to try and think of others just seems beyond us. Help can be done in any form and it will always be positive. Not everyone is good at everyone, but each of us have something  better than the other. Some people have so much in life while other struggle for basic necessity. Its good to help weather in sharing knowledge, food, advice or philosophy. Helping others not on provides them happiness it also provides us a feeling of satisfaction and positiveness.</p>
      <p>
      I feel a sense of encouragement and positiveness when I think about my values. Each value reminds me what I truly am and what means the most to me. Often, we feel jaded due to circumstances and reminded yourself of what you are is important. If I find msyelf feeling low at DBC, I will try and be open about speaking my mind and seek help via discussing. This will provide affirmation about myself and help me shun feelings of stereotype threat.
