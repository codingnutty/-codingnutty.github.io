  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>July 24 2015</h4>
  <section id="content">

    <p>“When people rely on surface appearances and false racial stereotypes, rather than in-depth knowledge of others at the level of the heart, mind and spirit, their ability to assess and understand people accurately is compromised.” ~~ James A. Forbes </p>
    <p>
     What are stereotyping? stereotyping is when you judge a group of people who are different from you based on your own or others opinions and encounters. How can this be a threat? We have all faced it. We feel especially smart and funny when talking to a particular person, only to feel hopelessly unintelligent and inarticulate in the presence of another.  Negative stereotypes concerning race and gender can sometimes prevent one's growth. Social Psycology expert Claude M. Steele's lecture made me realized that stereotype threats are a real curse on our modern society. I am sure most of us have been on both ends. In many situation's we would have formed a biased opinion on certain a group of people or their situation. While at the same time, there are people we might have encountered who may have formed a a baseless opinion about us which might have affected us.
    <p>
      It has been in the last couple of decades that there has been an agressive research on this topic. It has been found that equally intelligent women performed worse on a challenging math test than men. However, if women were made to believe that usually results show that women perform equal as men, the scores seem to match that of men. Similar research was performed based on race. When black students were asked to fill out a form before the test where they had to fill out details about their race and gender, the test results of black students seemed to drop. Similarly when white male students who scored high in math on the SAT performed worse when they were told they were taking a test to determine why Asian students typically outperform other students in math. Why would the results drop? why do such ocurances happen? It's because our human mind works like that. Certain belief which remain in our heads, unconsciously affect our performance and hence the growth. It is easy to break confidence while it is difficult to maintain it at all times.

      Thinking about stereotype threat brings to the times when I have been prey to stereotyping. I have noticed situations where people stereotype other quite often.  I believe that stereotyping is a common phenomenon worldwide. I did not grow up in the USA. I migrated here few years ago. The place where I belong, negetive stereotyping seems to be a common practise to me. I would like to mention two situaitons.</p>
      <p>
      All through the 90's and early 2000's there was an advertisement campaign for a faireness cream which portrayed women or with darker complexion to fail. Yes, there are creams that enable fair skin. Their first advertisement for this product was, a girl who was looking to date a guy and she doesn't find until she uses this product and becomes fair enabling her to find a guy to date easily. The next add for this product was women and men who are dark could not find a job. They have a successful interview and land one after using this product and becoming fair. This advertisement made millions of people with dark complexion feel lower than others or underconfident due to their complexion. Such adds do not affect a few individuals but a mass. This add campaign after a decade was shut due to complains for stereotype threat.

      Another incident that recently happened to me was related to my decision in joining Dev Bootcamp. I was unable to take the plunge and quit what I was doing due to fear of being judged. When I decided that I am going to quit my job and study to become a Software Engineer, people around were skeptical. Some of them felt, I was taking a rash decision by throwing away years of hardwork while others suggested against it as they felt that a person from biotech industry will never be able to be successful as a software engineer as the two things are poles apart. They suggested, I continue what I do, as software engineering is too difficult. I did feel demotivated because of this. I often get questioned looks when I say I am attending a bootcamp to become a sofware enginner. I feel people dont try and find out what the bootcamp is about or why I might have taken this decision before they jump to conclusions. In their minds,they would have made a judgement that the person has taken a random decision. There is a good chance that such judgements might stop many people from taking right decisions for themselves.

      Tackling stereotype threat is possible via awareness. When going in for a test one can stay aware of this threat and try to think of a positive role model to enable them to do well. Teachers in schools can enable prevent stereotype threats by encouraging students they can excel in difficult situations and achieve high rewards.  Also, trying and blaming less on luck and making people believe in themselves might help this situation. A lot of positive thinking and confidence building by close ones and mentors will help many benefit in society.
