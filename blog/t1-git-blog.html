      Welcome to my blog!
      This is my Phase0-Unit1-Week1 blog. This first week at DBC(DevBootcamp),I have had a great experience learning about the concept of version control and working with git and github. I am going to try and explain these concepts to the best of my knowledge.
      Version Control is concept that makes working on projects for developers very systematic and structured. An example I would like to use in order to explain this is creating a report on a word document.If we are team of 4 people and each of us are working on the same document, there are 4 different version of the report and multiple other documents containing changes done to that report. Ultimately it gets difficult to track which version was done by whom and what are changes.It all gets messy and no one actually has an idea about the "master" copy.

      Version control system is a tool that can provide a good escape to such situation. It helps manage and track all the changes done to a project without actually disturbing the original version. This is done by creating a branch and making changes within that branch. Once the changes are tested and finalized, the changes can be merged to the main content.If the current version or changes are buggy and one does not want to go further with it, it can be discarded and one can go back to an older version and resume. Since it keeps a record of the changes made to a file or a set of files over the course of the entire project,one can recall an older version at any point. That way there are not 5 different copies of the same file.There are different version control systems and one such system is Git.

      Git is an open source distributed version control system which resides in your local computer. Certain git commands enable us to create branches, make changes and intergrate it back.
      There are 3 stages to the file in git:
      working- while making changes
      staging-when git knows these edits can be confirmed and changes are set to be finalized
      commit- finalize the changes

      Github is a website thats hosts a collection of git repositories.It resides on the internet and not on the local computer like git.These repositories can be copied to the local computer and one can make changes to it.These changes can be updated back to the github repository. Multiple people across any the world can view and contribute to this repository.There is a feedback and communication system too on github which will enable easy team work.
      Hopefully I have been able to communicate my understanding on these concepts well.
      Signing off for week1.
      Adios and Happy Coding!
