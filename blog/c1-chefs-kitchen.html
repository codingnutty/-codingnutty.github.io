      Welcome to my blog on DBC Experience, their culture and my impression. I am going to write this based on a video by Shareef Bishay(Co-Founder DevBootcamp). It's an excellent video where Shareef states the expectations from a person who walks into DevBootcamp. I can't agree more when he says do not be the person who goes to a restaurant, orders food, pays the bill and goes home. He says, be the chef, feel like its your own. I feel very energetic and pumped hearing that.

      My primary reason to join Dev Bootcamp is the cultural aspect they provide. Mainly the EQ sessions and peer-pairing idea intrigued me. I expect that being a part of DevBootcamp is a going to be journey and every experience is worth a lifetime memory. As I come to the end of my first week, I feel all the more connected to this. It has been a great first week. I havn't learned concepts they way I have learnt things this week. This is all about a group of people from different paths and different walks of life coming to gether sharing a journey and experience.Its going to be an intense set of weeks and I am so eager to get on-site learn, help, gather and share.At the same time I am tensed about how I will manage through this. I am prepared to put my heart and soul out there. I am ready to fail and lift myself up from there and succeed. I cant wait to work with the great set of people. I know that each one of them carry a sack full of knowledge and experiences. I cant wait to connect and share all that I have. I will do everything to take home a life changing experience.

      This week apart from core technical concepts. I realized that the reflections I wrote at the end of every challenge was the most critical for my understanding. It made me not only think but also understand what I feel about everything that I am doing here. I realized I am in DevBootcamp for the process of lerning and the culture. I am hoping to explore my capabilities to to its complete stretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intend to make this experience my own and feel every bit of it. My cohort- my family. I am super excited.
