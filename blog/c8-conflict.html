  <h2>Handling Conflicts</h2>
  <h4>Aug 06 2015</h4>
  <section id="content">

    <p>
     "Conflict" usually associates with disharmony, friction, clash leading to a lot of stress.It is not uncommon in any organization, family or friends. Most of us have come across conflict in our life. It is important for us to deal with these conflicts by identifying the crux of the situation and breaking it down in simple splutions in order to resolve the conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, I have had situations when I had to come face to face with conflict. One such moment was with my room-mate. When we share an apartment with someone, there is a certain level of expectation and mutual understanding, especially when it came to harmony and cleanliness. My room-mate was in a logn distance relationship with her boyfriend. As he lived in a different country she would talk to him at night and often fought over their conversation. The issue was she was a dramatic person and she would scream and cry out so loud over the phone that it would make my and another room uneasy. Not only that her conversation would run into wee hours of the night so we would find it difficult to sleep with that level of noise. Initially our heart went our to her as she was struggling. Eventually it became nuisance to us. We once sat her down and told her about how she could lower her voice and handle the situation tactfully instead of breaking into dramatic fit. We also told her about how it was making it difficult for us sleep and had effects on our attentiveness at work the next day. She did not listen even after continuous advise and the other room-mate and me lost our cool once as we had been ignoring a conflict for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for our conflict was that we felt disrespected and ignored. Most importantly we felt that our room-mate was selfish and did not consider our issues even after advising her. The basic feelign we had throguh all this was frustration and anger. We had 3 options, one was to allow this to happen and we ignore it by using ear-plugs to sleep, two we confront her more strictly this time and ask her to take her fights out of the house or try and keep the volume low and third we break into a fight with her where all three of us would end up fighting and screaming at each other.
     </p>
     <p>
     We could have lost our temper, when one-night we tried to ask our room-mate to keep the volume low and she screamed back at us. We almsot lost our temper and were about to scream back when we realized that it would not be the best way to tackle this situation. We made our room-mate keep the phone down. We confronted her. At first, we were not sure if we should get ourselves invovled in her personal problems as we weren't that close but we went ahead and asked her what the issue was and if she would allow us to help her. She shared her issues with us and together we tried to advise her on how deal with it. We told her that, if she kept shouting the same way on phone it will affect her health too. We also told her about how we were worried at the same time affected with all this and getting up for work the next-day was difficult. She felt good after having that chat. The screaming reduced over time and eventually she made sure that she took her issues out of house at night and contorled her dramatic reactions.
     </p>
     <p>
     From this, I actually learnt how patience can help tackle situations. Understanding ourselved better will help control our first instinct of anger, think though the issue and understand the crux of the problem before reacting. This will help us deal with situations in a more calm and understanding manner.
