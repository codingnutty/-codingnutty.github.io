      <h2>Hello everyone!<br>
       Welcome to my webpage and get to know me here!</h2>
       <p>
       My name is Nruthya.I was born and raised in Mumbai,India.I moved to Boston to pursue my Masters.Boston is beautiful city,awesome student amosphere all over the place due to some top-tier universities like MIT and Havard.
     </p>
     <p>
       I recently moved to California,closer to google-land. I have suddenly found myself surrounded by techie's and tech talks all over the place.A general conversation would mostly be a new tehcnology in the market,a start-up which will soon make it big, Pre-IPO, IPO etc.I have been working in the pharmaceutical sectory for 4 years now.I was looking at options to switch to the tech field.Devbootcamp (DBC) came up though networking with some friends.It was most suitable for my future career path. I love technology myself hence I decided to finally let go of my fears and take the plunge to change my field. Watching some of the videos from previous DBC students shunned all my apprehension about not going back to a full-fledged school to pursue a 2 year masters.Here I am already 2 weeks into the course and I can't think of a better learning style.People who share my cohort are amazing and extremely helpful. I feel blessed to be amongst people who sail the same boat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Besides, I love travelling, art, dance and  photography.I have attempted adventure sports like sky diving and scuba diving. I like exploring life and culture.
    </p>
